🔍 Footprinting in Cybersecurity
📖 Definition:
Footprinting is the first step in ethical hacking or penetration testing, where an attacker or security professional gathers information about a target system, organization, or network — without interacting directly with the target in most cases.

It's part of the Reconnaissance phase and can be:

Passive (no interaction with the target)

Active (direct queries to the target)

🎯 Objectives of Footprinting:
Identify domain names, IP addresses, and DNS information

Gather information about employees, emails, or public data

Discover open ports, services, and operating systems

Map the network topology and security defenses

🧰 Common Footprinting Tools & Techniques:
✅ Passive Techniques (no direct contact)
Google Hacking (Google Dorking)

WHOIS lookup

DNS enumeration

Social media & LinkedIn

Wayback Machine

Public documents (PDFs, DOCX)

✅ Active Techniques
Ping sweeps

Traceroute

Port scanning (Nmap)

Banner grabbing

Network sniffing

📌 Footprinting Example:
To gather info about example.com, an attacker might:

Perform a whois example.com lookup

Use nslookup or dig to get DNS info

Search for subdomains using tools like Sublist3r

Scan IPs with Nmap for open ports and services

Look for employees or emails via LinkedIn

⚠️ Why It Matters:
Footprinting helps identify attack surfaces.

It’s used by ethical hackers to strengthen defenses and by malicious hackers to plan attacks.

The more information gathered, the better an attacker can craft a targeted approach.
